It was my first time in the area and I had no idea what to eat. We ended up at a small authentic Japanese restaurant where the menus were in a foreign language. Our group of friends was confused and had no idea how we were going to figure out what to order. The waitress saw our confusion and brought over a binder with photos of their dishes. This helped a bit but now had to wait for the binder to make its way around the table. I was hungry and getting anxious. It was in that moment that I realized how useful it would be to have photos and info for restaurant menus through my mobile phone. Soon after my trip i tried to find a solution for this problem, but I could not find one. I tried to use sources like Yelp and TripAdvisor. Yelp was great for finding a new restaurant but that\\u2019s where that ended. Yelp doesn\\u2019t have full menus, sometimes has pictures but they are not always good quality and aren\\u2019t labeled with dish names or organized. TripAdvisor was similar but not consistent either. And so SEEFOOD was born. \"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"a\", {\n    href: \"#\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 88,\n      columnNumber: 25\n    }\n  }, \"Read More\")))));\n}\n\nexport default Home;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/sam/Web Projects/seefood/src/home.js"],"names":["React","HeroLogo","Bubble","AppConcept","StoryImageOne","StoryImageTwo","Home"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,kBAAP;AACA,OAAOC,QAAP,MAAqB,yCAArB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,kCAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,4CAAvB;AACA,OAAOC,aAAP,MAA0B,8CAA1B;AACA,OAAOC,aAAP,MAA0B,8CAA1B;;AAEA,SAASC,IAAT,GAAgB;AACZ,sBACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAS,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,MAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,gBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAEL,QAAV;AAAoB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAAxB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0BAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,uGAHJ,CADJ,CADJ,eAQI;AAAS,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,gBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAEC,MAAV;AAAkB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAAtB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,aAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oQAHJ,CADJ,CARJ,eAiBI;AAAS,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,KAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,0BAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAEA,MAAV;AAAkB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAAtB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAFJ,eAGI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,SAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAG,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,aAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,yBAFJ,CAHJ,eAOI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,SAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAG,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,kBAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0CAFJ,CAPJ,eAWI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,SAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAG,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,iBAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,iDAFJ,CAXJ,CADJ,CAjBJ,eAmCI;AAAS,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,MAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,WAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAEC,UAAV;AAAsB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAA1B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,qBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAI,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,kBAAV;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAAI;AAAG,IAAA,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAAJ,CADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAAI;AAAG,IAAA,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAAJ,CAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAAI;AAAG,IAAA,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAAJ,CAHJ,CADJ,eAMI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,gBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAG,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,cAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,2BAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wJAHJ,CANJ,CAFJ,CADJ,CAnCJ,eAsDI;AAAS,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,iBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,iBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAEC,aAAV;AAAyB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAA7B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,eAEI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAEC,aAAV;AAAyB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAA7B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAFJ,CADJ,eAKI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,gBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,iBADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wnCAFJ,eAiBI;AAAG,IAAA,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,iBAjBJ,CALJ,CADJ,CAtDJ,CADJ;AAoFH;;AAED,eAAeC,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport './stylesheet.css';\nimport HeroLogo from './images/sf_images/seefood_logo_red.png';\nimport Bubble from './images/sf_images/sf_bubble.png';\nimport AppConcept from './images/sf_images/seefood_app_concept.png';\nimport StoryImageOne from './images/section_images/sf_story_image_1.png';\nimport StoryImageTwo from './images/section_images/sf_story_image_2.png';\n\nfunction Home() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <section class=\"hero\">\n                <div class=\"hero-container\">\n                    <img src={HeroLogo} alt=\"\" />\n                    <h1>Eat With Your Eyes</h1>\n                    <p>SeeFood helps create visual menus for restaurants and customers.

It\n                        was my first time in the area and I had no idea what to eat. We ended up at a small authentic\n                        Japanese restaurant where the menus were in a foreign language. Our group of friends was confused\n                        and had no idea how we were going to figure out what to order. The waitress saw our confusion and\n                        brought over a binder with photos of their dishes. This helped a bit but now had to wait for the\n                        binder to make its way around the table. I was hungry and getting anxious.\n\n                        It was in that moment that I realized how useful it would be to have photos and info for restaurant\n                        menus through my mobile phone.\n\n                        Soon after my trip i tried to find a solution for this problem, but I could not find one. I tried to\n                        use sources like Yelp and TripAdvisor. Yelp was great for finding a new restaurant but that’s where\n                        that ended. Yelp doesn’t have full menus, sometimes has pictures but they are not always good\n                        quality and aren’t labeled with dish names or organized. TripAdvisor was similar but not consistent\n                    either. And so SEEFOOD was born. </p>\n                        <a href=\"#\">Read More</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Home;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
