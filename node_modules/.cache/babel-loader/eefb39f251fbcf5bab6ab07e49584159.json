I have been fortunate enough to learn what my passion is and what motivates me. My passion is technology and I am motivated to build product that helps create experiences for people.  Some of my fondest memories have centered around the experience of dinning out and enjoying a meal with friends and family. I started SeeFood because I believe we can help make this experience even better.\")))));\n}\n\nexport default

Through  application and website development, and natural curiosity I have made it my goal to create stepping stones in technology for generations to come. Ultimately I strive to explore the intersection of technology and our daily lives by using the skills I have developed inside the classroom, through multiple projects, and through self taught courses to facilitate daily life activities. I thrive in an environment where creativity is essential for customer satisfaction while working part time as a home remodeler, and in my free time I enjoy exploring Mother Nature and the breathtaking landscapes it has to offer.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"team-box\">\n                    <img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/seefoodapp-eb81d.appspot.com/o/restaurants%2FgmsvxfhzpZpR4DqRov80%2Flogo%2FVilla%20Azteca%20Logo.png?alt=media&token=cb6953b1-ca69-4676-80e9-ff0eb8e9f665\" alt=\"\" />\n                    <div class=\"team-box-info\">\n                        <h3>Sam Ramirez</h3>\n                        <p>Lead Web Design and Development </p>\n                        <p>I’m a simple guy who loves to swipe through Pinterest all day.
