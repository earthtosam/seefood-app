                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The idea for SEEFOOD came a few years ago when I was out-of-town visiting a friend in Chico, CA. It
                    was my first time in the area and I had no idea what to eat. We ended up at a small authentic
                    Japanese restaurant where the menus were in a foreign language. Our group of friends was confused
                    and had no idea how we were going to figure out what to order. The waitress saw our confusion and
                    brought over a binder with photos of their dishes. This helped a bit but now had to wait for the
                    binder to make its way around the table. I was hungry and getting anxious.
                    ​
                    It was in that moment that I realized how useful it would be to have photos and info for restaurant
                    menus through my mobile phone.

                    Soon after my trip i tried to find a solution for this problem, but I could not find one. I tried to
                    use sources like Yelp and TripAdvisor. Yelp was great for finding a new restaurant but that’s where
                    that ended. Yelp doesn’t have full menus, sometimes has pictures but they are not always good
                    quality and aren’t labeled with dish names or organized. TripAdvisor was similar but not consistent
                    either. And so SEEFOOD was born. </p>
